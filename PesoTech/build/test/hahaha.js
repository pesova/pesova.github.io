##
Options
Note: any options that take country codes should be[ISO 3166 - 1 alpha - 2](http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes  

**
allowDropdown **
Type: `Boolean`
Default: `true`
Whether or not to allow the dropdown.If disabled, there is no dropdown arrow, and the selected flag is not clickable.Also we display the selected flag on the right instead because it is just a marker of state.

**
~~autoFormat~~[REMOVED] **
Automatically format the number as the user types.Unfortunately this had to be removed
for the reasons listed here: [#346 Disable and remove autoFormat feature](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/issues/346).



**autoHideDialCode**  

Type: `Boolean` Default: `true`  

If there is just a dial code in the input: remove it on blur or submit. This is to prevent just a dial code getting submitted with the form. Requires `nationalMode` to be set to `false`.



**autoPlaceholder**  

Type: `String` Default: `"polite"`  

Set the input's placeholder to an example number for the selected country, and update it if the country changes. You can specify the number type using the `placeholderNumberType` option. By default it is set to `"polite"`, which means it will only set the placeholder if the input doesn't already have one. You can also set it to `"aggressive"`, which will replace any existing placeholder, or `"off"`. Requires the `utilsScript` option.



**customContainer**  

Type: `String` Default: `""`  

Additional classes to add to the parent div.



**customPlaceholder**  

Type: `Function` Default: `null`  

Change the placeholder generated by autoPlaceholder. Must return a string.



```js

intlTelInput(input, {

  customPlaceholder: function(selectedCountryPlaceholder, selectedCountryData) {

    return "e.g. " + selectedCountryPlaceholder;

  },

});

```



**dropdownContainer**  

Type: `Node` Default: `null`  

Expects a node e.g. `document.body`. Instead of putting the country dropdown next to the input, append it to the specified node, and it will then be positioned absolutely next to the input using JavaScript. This is useful when the input is inside a container with `overflow: hidden`. Note that the absolute positioning can be broken by scrolling, so it will automatically close on the `window` scroll event.



**excludeCountries**  

Type: `Array` Default: `undefined`  

In the dropdown, display all countries except the ones you specify here.



**formatOnDisplay**  

Type: `Boolean` Default: `true`  

Format the input value (according to the `nationalMode` option) during initialisation, and on `setNumber`. Requires the `utilsScript` option.



**geoIpLookup**  

Type: `Function` Default: `null`  

When setting `initialCountry` to `"auto"`, you must use this option to specify a custom function that looks up the user's location, and then calls the success callback with the relevant country code. Also note that when instantiating the plugin, if the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) object is defined, one of those is returned under the `promise` instance property, so you can do something like `iti.promise.then(callback)` to know when initialisation requests like this have completed.



Here is an example using the [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) service:  

```js

intlTelInput(input, {

  initialCountry: "auto",

  geoIpLookup: function(success, failure) {

    $.get("https://ipinfo.io", function() {}, "jsonp").always(function(resp) {

      var countryCode =(resp && resp.country) ? resp.country : "";
    success(countryCode);
});
},
});
``
`
_Note that the callback must still be called in the event of an error, hence the use of `
always ` in this example._  
_Tip: store the result in a cookie to avoid repeat lookups!_

**hiddenInput**  
Type: `
String ` Default: `
""
`  
Add a hidden input with the given name. Alternatively, if your input name contains square brackets (e.g. `
name = "phone_number[main]"
`) then it will give the hidden input the same name, replacing the contents of the brackets with the given name (e.g. if you init the plugin with `
hiddenInput: "full"
`, then in this case the hidden input would have `
name = "phone_number[full]"
`). On submit, it will automatically populate the hidden input with the full international number (using `
getNumber `). This is a quick way for people using non-ajax forms to get the full international number, even when `
nationalMode ` is enabled. _Note: requires the input to be inside a form element, as this feature works by listening for the submit event on the closest form element. Also note that since this uses `
getNumber ` internally, it expects a valid number, and so should only be used after validation._

**initialCountry**  
Type: `
String ` Default: `
""
`  
Set the initial country selection by specifying its country code. You can also set it to `
"auto"
`, which will lookup the user's country based on their IP address (requires the `
geoIpLookup ` option - [see example](http://intl-tel-input.com/node_modules/intl-tel-input/examples/gen/default-country-ip.html)). Note that the `
"auto"
` option will not update the country selection if the input already contains a number.

If you leave `
initialCountry ` blank, it will default to the first country in the list.

**localizedCountries**  
Type: `
Object ` Default: ` {}
`  
Allows to translate the countries by its given iso code e.g.:

`
``
js { 'de': 'Deutschland' }
``
`

**nationalMode**  
Type: `
Boolean ` Default: `
true `  
Allow users to enter national numbers (and not have to think about international dial codes). Formatting, validation and placeholders still work. Then you can use `
getNumber ` to extract a full international number - [see example](http://intl-tel-input.com/node_modules/intl-tel-input/examples/gen/national-mode.html). This option now defaults to `
true `, and it is recommended that you leave it that way as it provides a better experience for the user.

**onlyCountries**  
Type: `
Array ` Default: `
undefined `  
In the dropdown, display only the countries you specify - [see example](http://intl-tel-input.com/node_modules/intl-tel-input/examples/gen/only-countries-europe.html).

**placeholderNumberType**  
Type: `
String ` Default: `
"MOBILE"
`  
Specify [one of the keys](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/src/js/utils.js#L119) from the global enum `
intlTelInputUtils.numberType ` e.g. `
"FIXED_LINE"
` to set the number type to use for the placeholder.

**preferredCountries**  
Type: `
Array ` Default: ` ["us", "gb"]
`  
Specify the countries to appear at the top of the list.

**~~preventInvalidNumbers~~ [REMOVED]**  
Prevent the user from entering invalid characters. Unfortunately this had to be removed for the reasons listed here: [#79 Limit Input Characters to Formatted String Length](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/issues/79#issuecomment-121799307).

**separateDialCode**  
Type: `
Boolean ` Default: `
false `  
Display the country dial code next to the selected flag so it's not part of the typed number. Note that this will disable `
nationalMode ` because technically we are dealing with international numbers, but with the dial code separated.

<img src="https://raw.github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/master/screenshots/separateDialCode.png" width="257px" height="46px">

**utilsScript**  
Type: `
String ` Default: `
""
` Example: `
"build/js/utils.js"
`  
Enable formatting/validation etc. by specifying the URL of the included utils.js script (or alternatively just point it to the file on [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/intl-tel-input)). The script is fetched when the page has finished loading (on the window load event) to prevent blocking (the script is ~215KB). When instantiating the plugin, if the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) object is defined, one of those is returned under the `
promise ` instance property, so you can do something like `
iti.promise.then(callback)
` to know when initialisation requests like this have finished. See [Utilities Script](#utilities-script) for more information. _Note that if you're lazy loading the plugin script itself (intlTelInput.js) this will not work and you will need to use the `
loadUtils ` method instead._


## Public Methods
In these examples, `
iti ` refers to the plugin instance which gets returned when you initialise the plugin e.g. `
var iti = intlTelInput(input)
`

**destroy**  
Remove the plugin from the input, and unbind any event listeners.  
`
``
js
iti.destroy();
``
`

**getExtension**  
Get the extension from the current number. Requires the `
utilsScript ` option.
`
``
js
var extension = iti.getExtension();
``
`
Returns a string e.g. if the input value was `
"(702) 555-5555 ext. 1234"
`, this would return `
"1234"
`

**getNumber**  
Get the current number in the given format (defaults to [E.164 standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)). The different formats are available in the enum `
intlTelInputUtils.numberFormat ` - which you can see [here](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/src/js/utils.js#L109). Requires the `
utilsScript ` option. _Note that even if `
nationalMode ` is enabled, this can still return a full international number. Also note that this method expects a valid number, and so should only be used after validation._  
`
``
js
var number = iti.getNumber();
// or
var number = iti.getNumber(intlTelInputUtils.numberFormat.E164);
``
`
Returns a string e.g. `
"+17024181234"
`

**getNumberType**  
Get the type (fixed-line/mobile/toll-free etc) of the current number. Requires the `
utilsScript ` option.  
`
``
js
var numberType = iti.getNumberType();
``
`
Returns an integer, which you can match against the [various options](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/src/js/utils.js#L119) in the global enum `
intlTelInputUtils.numberType ` e.g.  
`
``
js
if (numberType === intlTelInputUtils.numberType.MOBILE) {
    // is a mobile number
}
``
`
_Note that in the US there's no way to differentiate between fixed-line and mobile numbers, so instead it will return `
FIXED_LINE_OR_MOBILE `._

**getSelectedCountryData**  
Get the country data for the currently selected flag.  
`
``
js
var countryData = iti.getSelectedCountryData();
``
`
Returns something like this:
`
``
js {
    name: "Afghanistan (‫افغانستان‬‎)",
    iso2: "af",
    dialCode: "93"
}
``
`

**getValidationError**  
Get more information about a validation error. Requires the `
utilsScript ` option.  
`
``
js
var error = iti.getValidationError();
``
`
Returns an integer, which you can match against the [various options](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/src/js/utils.js#L153) in the global enum `
intlTelInputUtils.validationError ` e.g.  
`
``
js
if (error === intlTelInputUtils.validationError.TOO_SHORT) {
    // the number is too short
}
``
`

**isValidNumber**  
Validate the current number - [see example](http://intl-tel-input.com/node_modules/intl-tel-input/examples/gen/is-valid-number.html). Expects an internationally formatted number (unless `
nationalMode ` is enabled). If validation fails, you can use `
getValidationError ` to get more information. Requires the `
utilsScript ` option. Also see `
getNumberType ` if you want to make sure the user enters a certain type of number e.g. a mobile number.  
`
``
js
var isValid = iti.isValidNumber();
``
`
Returns: `
true `/`
false `

**setCountry**  
Change the country selection (e.g. when the user is entering their address).  
`
``
js
iti.setCountry("gb");
``
`

**setNumber**  
Insert a number, and update the selected flag accordingly. _Note that if `
formatOnDisplay ` is enabled, this will attempt to format the number according to the `
nationalMode ` option._  
`
``
js
iti.setNumber("+447733123456");
``
`

**setPlaceholderNumberType**  
Change the placeholderNumberType option.
`
``
js
iti.setPlaceholderNumberType("FIXED_LINE");
``
`


## Static Methods

**getCountryData**  
Get all of the plugin's country data - either to re-use elsewhere e.g. to populate a country dropdown - [see example](http://intl-tel-input.com/node_modules/intl-tel-input/examples/gen/country-sync.html), or to modify - [see example](http://intl-tel-input.com/node_modules/intl-tel-input/examples/gen/modify-country-data.html). Note that any modifications must be done before initialising the plugin.  
`
``
js
var countryData = window.intlTelInputGlobals.getCountryData();
``
`
Returns an array of country objects:
`
``
js
    [{
        name: "Afghanistan (‫افغانستان‬‎)",
        iso2: "af",
        dialCode: "93"
    }, ...]
``
`

**getInstance**  
After initialising the plugin, you can always access the instance again using this method, by just passing in the relevant input element.
`
``
js
var input = document.querySelector('#phone');
var iti = window.intlTelInputGlobals.getInstance(input);
iti.isValidNumber(); // etc
``
`

**loadUtils**  
_Note: this is only needed if you're lazy loading the plugin script itself (intlTelInput.js). If not then just use the `
utilsScript ` option._  
Load the utils.js script (included in the lib directory) to enable formatting/validation etc. See [Utilities Script](#utilities-script) for more information. This method should only be called once per page. If the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) object is defined, one of those is returned so you can use `.then(callback)
` to know when it's finished.
`
``
js
window.intlTelInputGlobals.loadUtils("build/js/utils.js");
``
`

**~~setCountryData~~ [REMOVED]**  
Set the plugin's country data. This method was removed because it makes much more sense to just use `
getCountryData ` and then modify that ([see example](http://intl-tel-input.com/node_modules/intl-tel-input/examples/gen/modify-country-data.html)) instead of having to generate the whole thing yourself - the country data has become increasingly complicated and for each country we now have five properties: the name, [iso2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), international dial code, priority (in case two countries have the same international dial code), and finally a list of area codes used in that country - see [data.js](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/src/js/data.js#L36) for more info.


## Events
You can listen for the following events on the input.

**countrychange**  
This is triggered when the user selects a country from the dropdown.
`
``
js
input.addEventListener("countrychange", function() {
    // do something with iti.getSelectedCountryData()
});
``
`
See an example here: [Country sync](http://intl-tel-input.com/node_modules/intl-tel-input/examples/gen/country-sync.html)  

**open:countrydropdown**  
This is triggered when the user opens the dropdown.  

**close:countrydropdown**  
This is triggered when the user closes the dropdown.  


## Utilities Script
The utilities script ([build/js/utils.js](build/js/utils.js)) is a custom build of Google's [libphonenumber](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber) which enables the following features:

* Formatting upon initialisation, as well as with `
getNumber ` and `
setNumber `
* Validation with `
isValidNumber `, `
getNumberType ` and `
getValidationError ` methods
* Placeholder set to an example number for the selected country - even specify the type of number (e.g. mobile) using the `
placeholderNumberType ` option
* Extract the standardised (E.164) international number with `
getNumber ` even when using the `
nationalMode ` option

International number formatting/validation is hard (it varies by country/district, and we currently support ~230 countries). The only comprehensive solution I have found is libphonenumber, from which I have precompiled the relevant parts into a single JavaScript file and included in the build directory. Unfortunately even after minification it is still ~215KB, but if you use the `
utilsScript ` option then it will only fetch the script when the page has finished loading (to prevent blocking). If size is not a concern, then you can manually include the script yourself however you like, and as long as it has loaded before you initialise the plugin then it should work fine.

To recompile the utils script yourself (e.g. to update the version of libphonenumber it is built from), see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-to-a-new-version-of-libphonenumber).


## Troubleshooting

**Full width input**  
If you want your input to be full-width, you need to set the container to be the same i.e.
`
``
css
    .iti { width: 100 % ; }
