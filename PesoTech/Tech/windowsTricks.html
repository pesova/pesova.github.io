                <div id="articleT"> <br> If you're a fan of that old-school (i.e. non-tiled) Start menu experience, you can still have it—sorta. If you right-click on the Windows icon in the bottom-left corner, it will prompt a textual jump menu with a number of familiar
                    popular destinations (Programs and Features, Search, Run). All these options are available through the standard menu interface, but you'll be able to access them quicker through this textual interface. </p>

                    Secret Desktop Button This desktop button actually dates back to Windows 7, but I embarrassingly only recently found out about it. On the bottom-right corner of your page, there's a secret desktop button. Don't see it? Look allll the way to the bottom
                    and right, to the side of the date and time. There you'll find a small little sliver of an invisible button. Click that and it will minimize all your open windows to clear the desktop. You can change the behavior of this in Settings,
                    between having to click or just having to hover the mouse over the corner.</p>

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT"> <br> This trick only works on Windows 10 as far as I can tell. It's complicated and probably not worth the effort for what you get out of it, but here you go: Right-click on the desktop > New > Shortcut. In the ensuing pop-up window, paste
                    the following line of code: </p> %windir%\System32\SlideToShutDown.exe <br> This creates a clickable icon on your desktop, which you can feel free to rename to whatever you'd like. To shut down via slide-down, double-click on the new
                    icon to prompt a pull-down shade. Then use your mouse to drag it down to the bottom of the screen. Keep in mind, this isn't sleep, this is a shutdown. </div>

                <div id="articleT"> <br> Are you a power user who wants access to your PC's nitty gritty? Then "God mode" is for you. Here's how to access it: Right-click on the desktop > New > Folder. Re-name the new folder with this bit of code: <br> GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}
                    <br> To enter the "God Mode" window, double-click the folder and go nuts. </div>

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT"> <br> It appears this feature is new to Windows 10 (at least, it's not available in Windows 7). It will probably only be useful to a narrow niche of user, but if you like to dig your virtual fingers into the innards of Windows via the Command
                    Prompt, Windows 10 provides a ghostly way to interface with it.
                    <p>
                        To access the Command Prompt (CP) interface in Win 10, click on the Windows menu and type "Command Prompt" to bring up quick access to the CP desktop app. Click that. To personalize the CP experience right-click at the top of the window to prompt a pop-up
                        menu and choose "Properties. <br> " Click over to the "Colors" tab to see a range of personalization options. At the bottom of this tab, you'll find the "Opacity" slider, which allows you to see through
                        the CP window. This feature lets you code away in the CP while simultaneously observing the desktop. If you are Windows-hack-y like that, go nuts.

                <div class="article-Topic"> Hack Into A Computer Which Is Connect On same network(Lan) </div> <br>

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT"> <br> What do we need ?
                    <p>
                        Windows Os Cain And Abel
                        <p>
                            Step 1:- Finding the target So first off we need to find a computer or the computer to hack into. So if your plugged in to the LAN, or connected to the WAN, you can begin. Open up Cain and Abel. This program has a built in sniffer feature. A sniffer looks
                            for all IP addresses in the local sub net. Once you have opened up the program click on the sniffer tab, click the Start/Stop sniffer, and then click the blue cross. Another window will pop up, make sure “All host in my subnet”
                            is selected, and then click ok. It should begin to scan. Then IP’s, computer names, and mac addresses will show up Now remember the IP address of the computer you are going to be breaking into. If you can’t tell whether the
                            IP address is a computer, router, modem, etc, that’s ok. During the next step we will begin our trial and error.</p>
                        <p>
                            Step 2:- Trial and error Now, we don’t know if we have our designated target, or if we have a computer or printer, or whatever else is on the LAN or WAN. If you did get the IP of the target though, I still recommend reading through this section, for it
                            could be helpful later on. Click on the start menu and go to run, type in cmd, and click ok. This should bring up the command prompt. From here we will do most of the hacking.</p>
                        <p>
                            Step 3:- Now I will be referring to certain commands that need to be inputted into the command prompt. I will put these commands in quotes, but do not put the quotes in the code when you type it into the prompt. I am only doing this to avoid confusion.
                            Let’s get back to the hacking. Type in “ping (IP address of the target).” For example in this tutorial, “ping 192.168.1.103.” This will tell us if the target is online. If it worked, it will look something like this. IF it
                            didn’t work, meaning that the target is not online, it will look something like this: If the target is not online, either switch to a different target, or try another time. If the target is online, then we can proceed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Step 4:– Gathering the information Now, input this command “nbtstat –a (IP address of target).” An example would be “nbtstat –a 192.168.1.103.” This will show us if there is file sharing enabled, and if there is, it will give us the: currently logged
                            on user, workgroup, and computer name.</p>
                        <p>
                            Step 5:- Getting In Finally it’s time. By now we know: that our target is online, our target has file sharing, and our target’s computer name. So it’s time to break in. We will now locate the shared drives, folders, files, or printers. </p><br>                        Type in “net view (IP Address of Target)” An example for this tutorial would be: “net view 192.168.1.103” <br> We have our just found our share name. In this case, under the share name is “C,” meaning that the only shared thing
                        on the computer is C. <br> Then to the right, under Type, it says “Disk.” This means that it is the actual C DISK of the computer.</p>
                    <p>

                        The C DISK can sometimes be an entire person’s hard drive. As you can see, for my hack I have already used “K,” so I used “G” instead. You may also do the same for multiple hacks. If it worked, it will say “The command completed successfully.” If not,
                        you will have to go retrace you steps. Now open up “my computer” under the start menu, and your newly created network drive should be there. Now, if you disconnect from the WAN or LAN, you will not be able to access this drive,
                        hence the name Network Drive.</p>
                    <p>
                        The drive will not be deleted after you disconnect though, but you won’t be able to access it until you reconnect to the network. So if you are doing this for the content of the drive, I recommend dragging the files and folders inside of the drive onto
                        your computer, because you never know if the target changes the sharing setting.</p>

                <div class="article-Topic"> How to Use Windows 7 Without Activation </div> <br>

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT"> <br> You have to use the same slmgr -rearm command in this method too. So here is the step-by-step method:
                    <p>
                        1. Click on "Start button -> All Programs -> Accessories". Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run As Administrator". If you are prompted to enter password, enter the password and continue. You can also open Command Prompt in Administrator mode
                        by typing "cmd" in Start Menu Search box and press "Ctrl+Shift+Enter".</p>
                    <p>
                        2. Now provide following command: slmgr -rearm Extend_Windows_Vista_and_7_Trial_Period.png</p>
                    <p>
                        3. You'll be prompted to restart Windows, restart it and the trial period will be reset to 30 days again.</p>
                    <p>
                        4. You can use the same command 3 times. In this way you'll be able to use Windows for 120 days without activation.</p>
                    <p>
                        5. Now its time for the main trick. Type regedit in RUN dialog box and press Enter. Now go to following key: For Windows Vista: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\SL For Windows 7: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
                        NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. In right-side pane, change value of SkipRearm to 1. Extend_Windows_Vista_7_Trial_Period.png</p>
                    <p>
                        7. Now you'll be able to use the slmgr -rearm command 8 more times. So you'll get total 360 days for using Vista and 7 without activation: 120 days by using slmgr -rearm command before registry editing + 240 days after registry editing || 360 days</p>
                </div>

                <div class="article-Topic"> Make a Super Hidden Folder in Windows Without any Extra Software </div> <br>

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT"> <br> Anyone that has used Windows for a while knows that they can right-click on a file or folder and edit its properties, more so its attributes to make it a so called “hidden” file or folder. The problem is that just as many people know
                    you can show files and folders that have the “hidden” attribute by simply changing a radio button under the folder view options.
                    <p>
                        The easiest way to make a real hidden file or folder is to mark it as an important operating system file, that way Windows won’t display it even if explorer is set to display hidden files and folders. <br> To do this we need to
                        launch a command prompt, so press the Win + R key combination and type cmd then hit the enter button. Now we are going to use the attrib command, so go ahead and type a command similar to the following (you’ll need to substitute
                        the path to your own folder here). attrib +s +h “C:\Users\Taylor Gibb\Desktop\Top Secret” You will need to replace the stuff in quotes to an absolute path of a folder or file on your system that you want to make hidden.</p>
                    <p>


                        Now if I go look for the Top Secret folder on my Desktop it is gone, even with explorer set to show hidden files and folders. To unhide the file or folder you can run the same command, except this time use “-“ instead of the “+” signs. attrib -s -h “C:\Users\Taylor
                        Gibb\Desktop\Top Secret” Like magic, my folder appeared again.</p>
                    <p>
                        Warning While this method will catch 99 percent of people, if I knew for a fact that there was a hidden folder on a system that I was looking for there are many ways that will expose the folder. The easiest would be to make explorer show operating system
                        files, which can be done through the same interface as showing hidden files. Although any ordinary user who un-checks the box will most probably be scared off by the warning message that appears. Hope this was informative, now
                        go hide all your things.</p>
