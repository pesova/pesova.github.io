                    <br> As stated above, the deep web is not a single location, but a whole class of different locations which share one thing in common – that they are hidden from search engines and regular internet users. Different areas of the deep
                    web therefore have different requirements for you to be able to access them, and any technology which you use will only give you access to its specific area of the hidden internet. Having said that, there is a very small number of
                    technologies used to create what is popularly called the ‘deep web’ or ‘darknet’, and one in particular which the vast majority of people use – TOR.

                    <br> You may have heard that there is some mysterious hidden internet called the ‘Deep Web’ or the ‘DarkNet’ that you can’t get to from Google, and which is hidden from most web surfers. Perhaps tales of the dark marketplaces selling
                    all kinds of legal and illicit goods anonymously for Bitcoin have picqued your curiosity, and you would like to take a look around and see what they are like. Perhaps you live in a country where social media and ordinary internet sites
                    are censored and you would like to visit a place where everyone is free to speak their mind freely and without fear of repurcussion.
                    <p>Use of Darknet:</P>

                    <p>A DarkNet is a private network. The internet, at its base, it a bunch of computers connected together. Usually we can connect to any computer we want to – we just need to know its address, in the form of an IP address or the familiar
                        website addresses which are mapped to them. In a darknet you maintain a list of trusted friends, and your computer can only connect to the people you know. This provides an even more private and secure corner of the internet than
                        you can get from a deep web, but also a much more limited one. Darknet and deep web technologies can be combined, as you will see below, to provide a balance of privacy and useability.</p>

                    <br> First, make sure all email programs or services you have configured to download mail from your old Gmail account using POP are closed or set not to check mail automatically. Then, to move (or copy) all received and sent emails
                    from one Gmail account to another Gmail account by having the new Gmail account fetch the messages:
                    <br>1.Log in to the account from which you want to import (bring over) mail.
                    <br>2.Click the Settings gear icon (⚙️) in the Gmail account's toolbar.

                    <br>6.Select archive Gmail's copy under When messages are accessed with POP to have your old account's inbox cleared; select delete Gmail's copy instead to move mail instead of copying it. Tips: If you do want to retain some messages
                    at the old account, they will be available in the Trash label for 30 days. You can also select keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox (unread) or mark Gmail's copy as read, of course.

                    <br> Malware is an abbreviated term meaning “malicious software.” This is software that is specifically designed to gain access or damage a website without the knowledge of the owner. There are various types of malware including spyware,
                    keyloggers, true viruses, worms, or any type of malicious code that infiltrates your website. Malware is commonly used to compromise passwords in cases such as this.

                    <br> A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyberattack where a malicious actor inserts him/herself into a conversation between two parties, impersonates both parties and gains access to information that the two parties were trying
                    to send to each other. A man-in-the-middle attack allows a malicious actor to intercept, send and receive data meant for someone else, or not meant to be sent at all, without either outside party knowing until it is too late. Man-in-the-middle
                    attacks can be abbreviated in many ways, including MITM, MitM, MiM or MIM. </div>

                    <br> Social engineering is an attack vector that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves tricking people into breaking normal security procedures. A social engineer runs what used to be called a "con game." Techniques
                    such as appeal to vanity, appeal to authority and appeal to greed are often used in social engineering attacks. Many social engineering exploits simply rely on people's willingness to be helpful. For example, the attacker might pretend
                    to be a co-worker who has some kind of urgent problem that requires access to additional network resources. </div>

                    or tablets/smartphones to gather information about that particular person who is using that gadget then it is included in visual hacking. Attacker might look into keyboard of victim to have an idea that what characters does his password
                    consist of. If the attacker has recognized that what keys were pressed on keyboard, then he would use brute-force attack to hack or crack victim's password. The attacker might make a video or take photos of his screen and/or keyboard

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT" class="article-text"> <br> Here, I am going to show you how to hide, encrypt and secure your data everywhere you go. We will be using a free and open Source tool called Truecrypt. Truecrypt is an incredible Software which does an extremely good job of encrypting
                    your data.
                    <br> Truecrypt encryption is thought to be unbreakable, even the FBI hackers can't break it. There are many ways to configure truecrypt, but here I will be discussing the simplest and most convenient Way. HoW to use truecrypt to encrypt
                    your files and folders? We Will Create a file container"much like a Secure Vault, You can decide the size of this vault. This vault is a single file and can have any extension and you can transfer it anywhere you like. You can open
                    the vault by opening it with truecrypt and entering the password. So, lets get started 1. Open truecrypt and click on Create Volume
                    <br> 2. Leave the default and Click next
                    <br> 3. Leave the default and click Next
                    <br> 4. Click Select File
                    <br> 5. Anywhere in your hard drive, just type any file name you want your container to be. Here its myfile.txt Note that.txt is just an extension, and it doesn't have any meaning in this regard. The idea is that people Will think
                    its a mere txt file. 6.Leave the default and Click next
                    <br> 7. Enter the desired size of the container and click next. I've made mine 3GB. Note that you cannot change the size of the container afterwards.
                    <br> 8. Create a strong password for your container. Note that the only way to crack truecrypt is to brute force it. So, if your password is at least 15 or 20 characters with all the special characters etc, it should theoretically
                    be impossible to break.
                    <br> 9. Move your mouse around a bit, and click Format. it may take sometime depending on your CPU power. After the format is complete, close the window.
                    <br> 10. Next, click on any drive in the list. I've clicked drive d. After that Select the file We Created earlier, myfile.txt. And finally click on Mount. 11 Once you press mount, it will ask for the password you set earlier. Click
                    Ok and you are done.

                <div id="articleT" class="article-text"> <br> DNS cache poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, is a type of attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the domain name system (DNS) to divert Internet traffic away from legitimate servers and towards fake ones. One of the reasons DNS
                    poisoning is so dangerous is because it can spread from DNS server to DNS server. In 2010, a DNS poisoning event resulted in the Great Firewall of China temporarily escaping China’s national borders, censoring the Internet in the USA

            <div id="articleT" class="article-text"> <br>Common and hugely destructive example of this technique could be when an attacker who builds a website that has a button on it that says “Click here for to enter the contest“. However, just beside the button, they put in an almost invisible
                frame that links to the ‘Delete all contacts’ of your Gmail account’. The victim tries to click on the button but instead actually clicks on the invisible button. Hence, the attacker has “hijacked” the user’s “click”, and hence the name
                Clickjacking. In recent times, Clickjacking has made its way to popular services including Adobe Flash Player and Twitter. Some attackers altered the Adobe Flash plugin settings. By loading this page into an invisible iframe, an attacker
                could trick a user into altering the security settings of Flash, giving permission for any Flash animation to utilize the computer’s microphone and camera. </div>
