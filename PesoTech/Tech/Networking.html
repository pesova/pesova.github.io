                <div id="articleT"> <br> DDos is defined as “Distributed Denail of Service Attack“. This tutorial explains what is DDosing and how to hack a website temporarily using DDos method. It is a very common news when you hear that a website is hacked by a group
                    or a website is crashed and etc. etc. Have you ever wonder how a hacker group take a website down or do you know the exact method of crashing a website? Actually there are several methods which are used by the hacker group. However,
                    using Distributed Denail of Service Attack technology, any small website can be crashed very easily.
                    <p>

                        HOW TO DDOS A WEBSITE MANUALLY USING WINDOWS COMMAND PROMPT : <br> Select a small website that you want to DDos attack. Find the IP address of the website. To find the IP address of a specific website just use the following command:
                        <br> ping www.example.com -t <br> The IP address looks similar to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Now type the following command: ping [ip address] -t -l 65500 <br> Run the command for hours. If possible use multiple computers to run the same
                        command at a same time. Now, when you visit the website after 2 or 3 hours, you will find the “website is temporary down” or “server unavailable” message. Note: You should have a internet connection with unlimited bandwidth. Otherwise
                        you lose all your internet bandwidth for performing the task.

                            Step 5: Click the Green Adapter icon as shown below. This means that you just configured the adapter and now you are turning it ON.</p>

                            Step 6: Now select the APR tab below as shown and now first click on the right side upper pane area. When you click that area the blue plus (“+”) icon will get enabled. Press that blue plus (“+”) icon.</p>
                        <p>
                            Step 7: This is very interesting step. Now we need to select the router`s IP address and click ok. This means that we want to listen to every packet that is sent to router. If we select any other IP address in our LAN network then we can listen to only
                            that particular HOST on the network. Since the router responds to all the request of HOSTS connected in a LAN. Thus we can listen to all the HOSTs.</p>
                        <p>

                            Step 8: Now click the Yellow Circle icon as shown. This means that we are starting ARP poisoning.</p>
                        <p>
                            Step 9: We can see that in the upper right panel there is an IP address of our router and when we press that Yellow Circle icon (button), it performs ARP poisoning.</p>
                        <p>
                            Step 10: Now click the password tab which is at the bottom. We can see that we are getting passwords of HTTP i.e. plain text session in our LAN network.</p>
                        <p>

                            Note: While performing this practical you will notice that there is significant reduction in he network speed. This is due to the fact that ARP spoofing on the LAN network creates many fake packets advertising other`s host identity. This can also create
                            DoS Attak on the LAN network as it creates many fake packets for processing thereby making unable for other HOST to make a request on the network.</p>

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT"> <br> Recently i had learn how to crack Wifi (WPA2-PSK) from Kali Linux,thought to share with you guys,this is just manipulation of some commands using kali linux terminal.
                    <p>
                        > First what is Wifi (WPA2-PSK) & (WEP) WPA stand for Wi-Fi Protected Access WEP stand for wired Equivalent Privacy</p>
                    <p>

                        Step 1: The first step is to verify the router configuration. Normally in a real penetration test we would not have this option, but since this is a home lab I have a little more flexibility. In this case the lab access point is securing the wireless
                        network Wireless Lab with WPA2-PSK. It using the passphrase Cisco123. You can use any wireless router to setup your wireless lab. Setup a old router and log into it setting it up as WEP for wireless security to use as a test router.
                        Have one other computer, tablet, or smartphone connected to it wirelessly since the encrypted data between the two will need to be captured. <br> The basic idea of this attack is to capture as much traffic
                        as possible using airodump-ng. Each data packet has an associated three byte Initialization Vector called IV’s. After the attack is launched the goal is to get as many encrypted data packets or IV’s as possible then use aircrack-ng
                        on the captured file and show the password.</p>
                    <p>

                        Step 2: The iwconfig command will show any wireless cards in the system. I am using a RealTek wireless card. Linux ships with the RealTek drivers, making it a Linux plug and play wireless card. The operating system recognizes a wireless interface named
                        wlan0.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Step 3: My next step will be to enable the wireless interface. This is accomplished issuing the ifconfig wlan0 up command.</p>
                    <p>
                        Step 4: I need to understand what wireless networks my wireless card sees. I issue the iwlist wlan0 scanning command. This command forces the wireless card to scan and report on all wireless networks in the vicinity. <br> You can
                        see from this example it found my target network: Wireless Lab. It also found the MAC address of my access point: 0E:18:1A:36:D6:22. <br> This is important to note because I want to limit my attack to this specific access point
                        (to ensure we are not attacking or breaking anyone else’s password). Secondly, we see the AP is transmitting on channel 36.This is important because it allows us to be specific on what wireless channel we will want our wireless
                        card to monitor and capture traffic from.</p>
                    <p>
                        Step 5: The next step is to change the wireless card to monitoring mode. This will allow the wireless card to examine all the packets in the air. We do this by creating a monitor interface using airmon-ng. Issue the airmon-ng command to verify airmon-ng
                        sees your wireless card. From that point create the monitor interface by issuing the command: airmon-ng start wlan0 Next, run the ifconfig command to verify the monitor interface is created. We can see mon0 is created. Now verify
                        the interface mon0 has been created.</p>
                    <p>
                        Step 6: Use airodump-ng to capture the WPA2 handshake. The attacker will have to catch someone in the act of authenticating to get a valid capture. Airodump-ng will display a valid handshake when it captures it. It will display the handshake confirmation
                        in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Note: We will manually connect to the wireless network to force a handshake. In a future post I will show you how to force a reauthorization to make a device automatically disconnect
                        and reconnect without any manual intervention. We used the following command:
                        <p> airodump-ng mon0 – -bssid 20:aa:4b:1f:b0:10 (to capture packets from our AP) – –channel 6 (to limit channel hopping) – –write BreakingWPA2 (the name of the file we will save to) airodump-ng mon0 – -bssid 0E:18:1A:36:D6:22 – –channel
                            36 – –write BreakingWPA2 (make sure there is no space between “- -“) <br> To capture the handshake you are dependent on monitoring a legitimate client authenticate to the network. However, it does not mean you have to wait
                            for a client to legitimately authenticate. You can force a client to re-authenticate (which will happen automatically with most clients when you force a deauthorization). When you see the WPA Handshake Command you know you
                            have captured an valid handshake example:</p>
                        <p>
                            Step 7: We will use aircrack-ng with the dictionary file to crack the password. Your chances of breaking the password are dependent on the password file. <br> The command on is: aircrack-ng “name of cap file you created” -w
                            “name of your dictionary file” The BreakingWPA2-01.cap file was created when we ran the airodump-ng command. The valid WPA2 handshake airodump captured is stored in the BreakingWPA2-01.cap file. Backtrack 5 ships with a basic
                            dictionary.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The dictionary file darkc0de.lst is a popular worldlist that ships with BackTrack5. We added our password Cisco123 in this file to make the test run a little smoother Many attackers use large dictionaries that increase their chances of cracking a passwords.
                            <br> Many dictionaries contain passwords from real users and websites that have been cracked and posted on the Internet. Some sophisticated dictionaries combine multiple languages, permutations of each word, and key words and
                            phrases from social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Kali does not come with the darkc0de.lst but you can download it from here NOTE: Kali does have built-in worldlists in: /usr/share/worldlist In this blog we created
                            a file named “sample.lst” and added the word Cisco123 in it. <br> Success: If the password is found in the dictionary file then Aircrack-ng will crack it.</p>
