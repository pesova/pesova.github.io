            <div id="articleT"> <br> The C programming language is a structure oriented programming language, developed at Bell Laboratories in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie C programming language features were derived from an earlier language called “B” (Basic Combined Programming
                Language – BCPL) C language was invented for implementing UNIX operating system In 1978, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published the first edition “The C Programming Language” and commonly known as K&R C In 1983, the American National
                Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to provide a modern, comprehensive definition of C. The resulting definition, the ANSI standard, or “ANSI C”, was completed late 1988.
                <p>
                    Features of C programming language: C language is one of the powerful language. Below are some of the features of C language. <br> Reliability <br> Portability <br> Flexibility <br> Interactivity <br> Modularity <br> Efficiency and

                        Uses of C programming language: The C programming language is used for developing system applications that forms a major portion of operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux. Below are some examples of C being used. <br>                        Database systems <br> Graphics packages <br> Word processors <br> Spreadsheets <br> Operating system development <br> Compilers and Assemblers <br> Network drivers <br> Interpreters <br>

            <div id="articleT"> <br> C++ is one of the most popular languages primarily utilized with system/application software, drivers, client-server applications and embedded firmware. The main highlight of C++ is a collection of predefined classes, which are data types
                that can be instantiated multiple times. The language also facilitates declaration of user-defined classes. Classes can further accommodate member functions to implement specific functionality.
                <p> Multiple objects of a particular class can be defined to implement the functions within the class. Objects can be defined as instances created at run time. These classes can also be inherited by other new classes which take in the public
                    and protected functionalities by default.

                            constraints.
                            <p> C++ is widely used for teaching and research because it is clean enough for successful teaching of basic concepts. Anyone who has used either an Apple Macintosh or a PC running Windows has indirectly used C++ because the primary
                                user interfaces of these systems are written in C++.

                device and internet of things development. Java was designed to have the look and feel of the C++ language, but it is simpler to use than C++ and enforces an object-oriented programming model. <br> Java can be used to create complete applications
                that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a small application module or applet for use as part of a webpage.

            <div id="articleT"> <br> Database is a systematic collection of data. Databases support storage and manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy. Let's discuss few examples. An online telephone directory would definitely use database to store data
                pertaining to people, phone numbers, other contact details, etc.
                <p> Your electricity service provider is obviously using a database to manage billing , client related issues, to handle fault data, etc. Let's also consider the facebook. It needs to store, manipulate and present data related to members,
                    their friends, member activities, messages, advertisements and lot more. We can provide countless number of examples for usage of databases .
                    <p>

                        What is a Database Management System (DBMS)? <br> Database Management System (DBMS) is a collection of programs which enables its users to access database, manipulate data, reporting / representation of data . It also helps to
                        control access to the database. Database Management Systems are not a new concept and as such had been first implemented in 1960s. Charles Bachmen's Integrated Data Store (IDS) is said to be the first DBMS in history. With time
                        database technologies evolved a lot while usage and expected functionalities of databases have been increased immensely.
