                    <p>Ethical Hacking is an authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security experts to perform such activities
                        in order to test the system’s defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more importantly, legal.</p>

                    <p> Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the system/network/applications.
                        By doing so, they can improve the security footprint so that it can better withstand attacks or divert them.</p>

                    <p> Ethical Hackers check for key vulnerabilities include but are not limited to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Injection attacks</li>
                        <li>Changes in security settings</li>
                        <li>Exposure of sensitive data</li>
                        <li> Breach in authentication protocols</li>
                        <li>Components used in the system or network that may be used as access points</li>

                <div class="article-Topic"> Top hacking groups that changed the world like no one else </div> <br>

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT"> <br> 1) Anonymous <br>
                    <p>Famous with the general populace for their vendetta (pun intended) against ISIS while donning the Guy Fawkes masks, Anonymous is an open online creation group spread in many parts of the world. They stand against the injustice of all
                        kinds, keeping with their personality of vigilantes that becomes apparent with their Guy Fawkes masks. They acted against the Church of Scientology, hacked the Pentagon, attacked Visa, PayPal and MasterCard for refusing payments
                        to WikiLeaks, and took down some websites belonging to ISIS. Many individuals from countries like Netherlands, USA, UK, Australia, Spain, and Turkey have been arrested for being allegedly belonging to Anonymous.</p>
                    <p>

                        2) Lizard Squad <br> Lizard Squad’s list of victims includes high profile websites like the Malaysian Airlines website, where users were redirected to a page with the message “404- plane not found”, and Facebook. Although Facebook
                        denied being hacked, their network was down for some time due to a DDoS attack by Lizard Squad. The group has also attacked Sony and Microsoft, with their members posting ISIS flags on Sony’s servers. Some members were arrested
                        in USA and England following their Xbox and PlayStation hacks. The Level Seven Crew One of the most notorious groups of previous years, The Level Seven Crew was involved in some big hacks in 1999 but their functioning stopped in
                        2000. They were allegedly inspired by the seventh level of hell according to Dante’s Inferno, which is the violent level. Their list of victims includes The First American National Bank, NASA, the US Embassy in China’s Website,
                        and Sheraton Hotel.</p>
                    <p>

                        3) Chaos Computer Club <br> Founded in Berlin in 1980 and one of the largest European Hacking groups, CCC is one of the good hacking groups of the world that has been teaching the common public about technology since the 1980s.
                        The working of CCC is directed towards uncovering security flaws in major government and non-government services. They said that they had to consult a lot of legal advisors before ascertaining what is illegal hacking and what the
                        grey area of legality in hacking is. They clarified their intentions when they stole 134,000 marks from a bank in Hamburg using their Bildschirmtext page. They showed their true intentions by returning back the entire money after
                        exposing the security flaw in the website. However, they have been found guilty of selling U.S corporations’ and government’s source code to the KGB.</p>
                    <p>

                        4) LulzSec <br> This group, short for Lulz Security, was founded as a spinoff of Anonymous after the 2011 HBGarry Hack. Their slogan said “laughing at your security since 2011”. Their existence was announced to the world when they
                        first hacked Fox.com, followed by Sony Pictures, in 2011. After that, LulzSec took down CIA’s website as well. However, in 2012, the group members were arrested by the FBI because their leader, named Sabu, gave them away.</p>
                    <p>

                        5) Syrian Electronic Army <br> Syrian Electronic Army aka SEA, is one of the groups that has a strict purpose of their functioning, which is to stamp out opposition groups in Syria. They are widely accredited to be active supporters
                        of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and identify themselves as active Syrian youths who will not stand by idly to watch massive distortion of facts about recent uprisings in Syria. Their activity is routinely marked by posting
                        of the Syrian flag on a victim’s website, with the group using techniques like phishing, DDoS attacks, spamming, and malware. They have targeted Twitter accounts as well as Facebook pages of influential people like Barack Obama
                        and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>
                    <p>

                        6) GlobalHell <br> This was a hacking group that was started by a street-gang member named Patrick Gregory. The group’s activity includes hacking some 115 websites and destroying their data leading to millions of dollars’ worth
                        damage. Although Gregory took to computers, his group behaved in a similar way a street gang does, with the group regularly writing “global hell will not die” on US Army’s website.</p>

                <div class="article-Topic"> Ways to Become the Ultimate Script Kiddie/Hacker </div> <br>

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT"> <br> You do not need to learn C, C++, C#, Python, Perl, PHP, Assembly and other computer programming languages since Kali, Parrot OS, and Backbox Linux have scripts and GUIs for performing penetration testing, wireless cracking, and vulnerability
                    assessment.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Use r57, c100 or c99 shells as your backdoor shells as a proof that you were able to hack their web application and have gained access to the server.</p>
                    <p>

                        Use the Hail Mary attack in Armitage in a covert penetration test because the GUI is awesome. It is very cool and totally legit.</p>
                    <p>

                        You don’t need to know the exploits being launched. You don’t need to study exploit development or all those EIP and ESP stuffs since you can just download any exploits in Exploit-DB or Packet Storm. The Metasploit Framework has a bunch of exploits too
                        so no worries. Some forums have exploit kits that are free to download and you should be all right with it.</p>
                    <p>


                        Make unbelievable claims that you are the world’s no. 1 hacker and write a book about your hack escapades and adventures.</p>
                    <p>

                        Trust and use SubSeven, DarkComet RAT or Lost Door Remote Administration Tools (RAT).</p>
                    <p>

                        Use wifite (automated wireless auditor), Gerix Wifi Cracker, WepAttack and Fern WiFi Cracker without having to know how to use Aircrack-ng Suite.</p>
                    <p>

                        Use Burp Suite Professional’s Active scanning always when auditing web apps – it’s all about the threads. Also do not trust the Web Application Hacker’s Handbook – it takes time.</p>
                    <p>

                        Treat Acunetix, Netsparker, HP Webinspect, Core Impact and IBM Appscan as your ultimate web application hacking tools.</p>
                    <p>

                        You don’t need to learn about networking, TCP/IP, and IPv6 since there are various GUI tools for automating network penetration testing and network pwnage. You don’t need to be quiet in order to hear better, sometimes you need brute force if it just doesn’t
                        work out well.</p>
                    <p>

                        Download as many hacking tools as you can. Fill up your hard drive with loads of it. Turn off your antivirus if it detects some of your tools as malicious.</p>
                    <p>

                        Create your own security blog that rips off other articles from known InfoSec blogs. If you can’t hack a certain website with your tools, just suppress it by DDoSing their site. Sometimes you just need to annoy them in order to teach them instead of outsmarting
                        them.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Create your own underground group then deface as many websites as you can with your group name on it like “Owned by fs0ciety! Nothing was harmed except your pride” without knowing what attacks you have conducted. You don’t need to understand the concepts
                        of how an operating system works.</p>
                    <p>

                        Create your own “Self-Interview” without being asked by a news editor and have it published online. Self-promotion is good so that you can spread how you started hacking and share the tools that you used.</p>
                    <p>

                        Create an ub3rl33t handle with numbers in it e.g. 4h4ck3r, d1v1d3sbyz3r0, z3r0c00l, 3n1gm4, j3j3m0n, m4st3rsw0rd, k3rn3l 3.0, etc.</p>
                    <p>

                        Do not resist the urge to use LOIC, WiNuke, Cain and Abel, Back Orifice, ProRat, exploit kits, Trojans, and malware without understanding how it works and its underlying concepts. UNIX is just too old. You don’t need to study it. You have Windows, anyway.</p>
                    <p>

                        Do not contribute to open source tools like Metasploit, Nmap Scripts, SQLmap, and wpscan. Just use them anyway! Do not responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities that you have found or do not submit vulnerability findings and exploits in PacketStorm and
                        Exploit-DB.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Create an army of zombie computers and botnets by using available tools online. You can rip off some known malware in the wild. Sometimes you don’t need to “Try Harder” as what the Offensive Security Course always says. The easy way is better.</p>
                    <p>

                        Threaten that you will hack people if they agitate you. If you have problems installing penetration-testing distributions, just use Windows and download alternative packages and bundles for hacking.</p>

                <div class="article-Topic"> Best Software Development Tools Every Developer Should Use.</div> <br>

                <button onclick=TextOpener(this) id="btn">show</button>


                <div id="articleT"> <br> Git and GitHub: <br> Although there are companies that still use Subversion or CVS even, let alone the awful Clearcase, you probably shouldn’t work at one of them. Git is now a basic skill like tying your shoes or spell checking.
                    <p>

                        SSH :- <br> Yeah, I know: You’re a Windows developer and you don’t know no stinking shell. But you’re going to run into having to create an SSH key or do other SSH stuff. So you may as well learn now.</p>
                    <p>

                        Terminal Services or remote login <br> :- Even if you’re a Linux or Mac person, sooner or later you’ll have to deal with Windows. These tools are how you will connect in.</p>
                    <p>

                        Amazon Web Services: <br>AWS isn’t just cloud, it is the reason you don’t have to wait on IT. There are other cloud providers, but you’ll have to deal with AWS sooner or later. AWS has gotten so big that you can’t know all of AWS
                        any more, but you do need to know at least the EC2 stuff.</p>
                    <p>

                        JavaScript :-: <br> You don’t need to know it cold, but this is the scripting language of the now. If a product or tool is going to add a scripting API, it will probably be for JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>

                        Bash and PowerShell :- <br> Sure, more modern devops tools are handy, but sooner or later something isn’t going to work and it won’t have quite what you need. So, expect to need to know how to write a basic restart script, grab
                        an error code from an exiting command, or do a few things in a loop. That’s what Bash (in Linux, many Unixes, MacOS, and Windows 10) and Microsoft’s PowerShell let you do. Bonus: Add a tool like Grep (PowerShell’s equivalent Select-String
                        is more wordy) and you’ll be an even more powerful deity.</p>
                    <p>

                        MongoDB :- <br> You need to know how to work with at least one document database. MongoDB is the easiest to learn. Whether you’re ultimately going to use MongoDB isn’t relevant; what matters is learning how to deal with a new-generation
                        database. If you’re going to use an index like Apache Solr, which is document-shaped, or you’re going to work with a more columnar structured database, the MongoDB skills will transfer.</p>
                    <p>

                        Curl and Invoke-RestMethod :- <br> Most software now has a REST API. On Mac and Linux, Curl is the command-line tool that lets you test and tweak and even script against a REST API. In PowerShell, it is Invoke-RestMethod (although
                        like everything on PowerShell, it requires more typing). There are GUI tools like Postman that accomplish the same work, but a serious developer needs to be able to move past a point-and-click interface for efficiency’s sake.</p>
                    <p>

                        Markdown :- <br> This is the format of the README.md file in GitHub. You should be able to read and write a simple Markdown document. And that’s easy because it has just seven symbols: (# is a header, ## is a subheader, * is a
                        bullet, __ and ** are bold, _ and * are italics, ` is monospace, and --- is a break or rule). Markdown editors often have extensions but those are the basics. From that basic markup language, you can get slides, PDFs, and HTML.
                        Often these output formats can be consistently formatted with CSS or some other way. Best of all, you don’t end up with smart quotes in your code samples.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Basic HTML :- <br> I can’t make a decent-looking web page to save my life; I’m a back-end developer. But whether you’re going to stub something out or have to parse HTML, you will need to know basics of the web markup language.</p>
                    <p>

                        Bootstrap: – <br> One of the most popular developer tools that still tends to be fresh in 2017. Bootstrap Studio is a desktop application that helps you create the best websites. To start a new web project, you will need to use
                        a UI kit to speed up your development process and Bootstrap is one among them. It comes with a large number of built-in components, which you can drag and drop to assemble responsive web pages. It also has custom JavaScript controls
                        such as modal windows, tooltips and carousel.</p>
                    <p>

                        BitBucket: – <br> BitBucket is one of the best code repositories for developers to store and share their code for a more efficient and collaborative work. That is every developer wants to have a back-up of his code in the cloud
                        as he can’t take the risk of mislaying the project code. It makes a developer’s work easy by facilitating a better way to team up with their team. Bitbucket has 3 deployment models: Cloud, Bitbucket Server and Data Center.</p>
